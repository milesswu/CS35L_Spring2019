1. BeagleBone Setup
Plugged in beaglebone
Ensured required drivers were installed
Used ssh to connect to BeagleBone
Followed connmanctl steps to connect to wifi
Found IP address using ifconfig: 10.97.85.177
Updated apt-get database
Installed xauth and xvfb for X11 forwarding support
Checked whether X11 is disabled: had to install emacs and edit the
file /etc/ssh/ssh_config
Installed Firefox
Ensured openssh-server and openssh-client installed

Commands:
sudo ssh debian@192.168.7.2
connmanctl
connmanctl> enable wifi
connmanctl> scan wifi
connmanctl> services
connmanctl> agent on
connmanctl> connect wifi_2cf7f1067932_4352333736302d77696669_managed_psk
Passphrase? 3760ClassNet
connmanctl> quit
ifconfig
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install xauth
sudo apt-get install xvfb
sudo apt-get install emacs
emacs /etc/ssh/ssh_config
sudo apt-get install firefox-esr-l10n-en-gb
sudo apt-get install openssh-server
sudo apt-get install openssh-client

2. Server Setup
Generated public and private keys
Created an account for client to allow partner to ssh to my machine
Created a .ssh directory
Changed ownership and permission on .ssh directory

Commands:
ssh-keygen
sudo useradd -d /home/~ -m danieladea
sudo passwd danieladea
cd /home/~
sudo mkdir .ssh
sudo chown -R danieladea .ssh
sudo chmod 700 .ssh

3. Client side
Generated public and private keys
Copied public key to server
Added private key to ssh-agent
Connected to server using server side created username and password
Attempted to run firefox but had troulbe setting up the X forwaring,
therefore ran some basic commmands instead

Commmands:
ssh-keygen
ssh-copy-id -i danieladea@10.97.85.177
ssh-add
ssh danieladea@10.97.85.177
exit
ssh -X danieladea@10.97.85.177
firefox
mkdir test
ls
