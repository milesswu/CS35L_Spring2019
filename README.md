# CS35L_Spring2019
All Assignments from Software Construction Lab

The files contained in this repository are all those I used to develop programs/solutions to fulfill the specifications of
  homework assignments at UCLA's CS35L Software Construction Lab in Spring 2019. 
  
assign1
Outlines my learning process on basic Linux Commands and using Emacs.

assign2
Utilizes shell scripting to automate tasks.
In the lab assignment, used regex to run an EnglshChecker on a webpage. Based on this
  EnglishChecker, created a HawaiianChecker script designed to check the spelling of words of some file based on a self created Hawaiian
  dictionary.
The homework assignment involved creating a shell script to automate filename validity checking. Impleented a recursive checker to do so.
  
assign3
Introduced patching and Python.
Created a Python equivalent to the shuf Linux Command. 

assign4
Creating C programs, focus on data alloocation.
Implemented a program to sort frobnicated data wihtout directly unfrobnicating and storing unfrobnicated data. 
Designed in a way to accept input from stdin.

assign5
Continuation of C development.
Created C equivalent to the Linux tr command, using both buffered and unbuffered input/output.
Expanded on previous assignment to use system calls to take data from stdin or from a file.

assign6
Multithreading/Parallelism.
Utilized POSIX threads to parallelize the simple ray tracing program provided by instructor.

assign7
Static/Dynamic Linking and Dynamic Loading.
Took a given program and modified source files to utilize dynamic loading and dynamic linking instead of static linking.

assign8
SSH
Setup and conneccted BeagleBone with a partner to create a secure communication session using SSH.

assign9
Git
Explored basic concepts in git.
