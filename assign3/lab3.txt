1.
Used wget to download coreutils-8.29 into home directory.
Used wget to get the signature and GNU keyring for coreutils-8.29.
Unzipped the tarball.
Verified signature using given command.
The warning that comes with the verify command is due to the fact that the key
is public and therefore is not verified by the user.

Shell Commands:
wget ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-8.29.tar.xz
tar -xJvf coreutils-8.29.tar.xz
wget ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-keyring.gpg
wget ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig
gpg --verify --keyring ./gnu-keyring.gpg coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig

Output:
gpg: Signature made Wed 27 Dec 2017 10:29:05 AM PST using RSA key ID 306037D9
gpg: Good signature from "Pádraig Brady <P@draigBrady.com>"
gpg:                 aka "Pádraig Brady <pbrady@redhat.com>"
gpg:                 aka "Pádraig Brady <pixelbeat@gnu.org>"
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
Primary key fingerprint: 6C37 DC12 121A 5006 BC1D  B804 DF6F D971 3060 37D9

2.
Created temporary directory.
Used the ./configure command in the coreutils-8.29 directory to install
coreutils in the temporary directory, making sure to provide an absolute path.  
Compiled and installed using make and make install.
Needed to use --prefix for the configure comand otherwise the make install
command would not work in the desired way.

Shell Commands:
mkdir coreutilsInstall
cd coreutils-8.29
./configure --prefix=/u/eng/ugrad/milesw/coreutilsInstall
make
make install

3.
Tested for the bug described using /usr/bin/ls and the coreutils ls command.
Noted that -a overrides -A no matter what ordering for both ls commands.

Shell commands:
/usr/bin/ls -a -A
/usr/bin/ls -A -a
cd coreutilsInstall/bin
./ls -a -A
./ls -A -a

4.
Copied contents of attatched patch into a patch_file inside the coreutils-8.29
directory.
Used the patch command to apply patches, using the -p1 option to remove the a/
and b/ prefixes before file names.
Received a hunk failure message regarding the NEWS file, which isn't present.

Shell Commands:
cd ~/coreutils-8.29
emacs patch_file
patch -p1 < patch_file

5.
Ran make to compile, received an error 'automake1.15' missing.
Ran autoreconf -f -i to fix problem.
Ran make again to compile changed files.

Shell Commands:
make 
autoreconf -f -i
make

6.
Tested modified and unmodified ls on directory with a hidden file.
Noted that the modified ls command no longer has buggy behavior.
Noted that unmodified ls command still produces bug.

Shell Commands:
mkdir empty
mkdir hidden
touch hidden/.test
cd empty
ls -a
ls -A
ls -aA
ls -Aa
~/coreutilsInstall/bin/ls -a
~/coreutilsInstall/bin/ls -A
~/coreutilsInstall/bin/ls -aA
~/coreutilsInstall/bin/ls -Aa

Output:
ls -a:
.  ..	.test

ls -A:
.test

ls -aA:
.test

ls -Aa:
.  ..	.test

~/coreutilsInstall/bin/ls -a:
.  ..   .test

~/coreutilsInstall/bin/ls -A:
.test

~/coreutilsInstall/bin/ls -aA:
.  ..   .test

~/coreutilsInstall/bin/ls -Aa:
.  ..   .test
